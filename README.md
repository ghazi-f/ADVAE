# Towards an Unsupervised Disentanglement of Content in Sentence Representations via Syntactic Roles
This is the code for our paper [Towards an Unsupervised Disentanglement of Content in Sentence Representations via Syntactic Roles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11184).

A model can be trained by running disentangle_train.py with default arguments.
The scripts to run all the experiments can be found in launch_scripts/disentangle/different_sizes.sh
